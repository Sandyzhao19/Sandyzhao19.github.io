## Donation platforms

In order of preference:

* [Stripe](https://buy.stripe.com/4gwbLebCM02k0h2aEE) (Amounts are in **Canadian Dollars**)
* [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/austinhuang/donate) (Amounts are in **Canadian Dollars** by default, can be changed)
* [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/austinhuang) (Amounts are in **Canadian Dollars**)
* [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/austinhuang0131) (Amounts are in **US Dollars**).

I strongly discourage the use of PayPal, but if that's your only choice, then please consider paying [fees](https://thefeecalculator.com/) for me as well. (I currently do not pay Stripe fees.)

## Other methods

I can accept Interac E-Transfers, cryptocurrencies, and gift cards. Please reach out to me first.

## Ledger

Here I list most donations since August 2020, excluding those not converted to CAD and DTel-related payments.

All currencies are in Canadian dollars (CAD) unless otherwise specified. Fees are deducted.

[^1]: Actually paid €9.00 but was written as so on Liberapay.
[^2]: Includes *some* [x2 matching](https://docs.github.com/en/sponsors/getting-started-with-github-sponsors/about-github-sponsors#about-the-github-sponsors-matching-fund), but since GitHub does not distinguish them on the transaction record, I have no way to know how much was matched.
