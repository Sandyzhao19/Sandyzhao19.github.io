I [write code](#my-tech-stuff), [take photos](#my-photos), study, and [explore online stuff](#my-other-online-stuff). You may reach me using [these methods](#contact-me). Straight outta the metropolis of Shanghai, China, I currently reside in Montréal, Canada, studying statistics & computer science at McGill University.

A **redacted** version of my resume is available [here](./assets/online_resume.pdf) for public viewing. Employers should [contact me](#contact-me) instead.


## My tech stuff

<div style="float:right;padding:15px;">
<a href="https://www.zylstra.org/blog/2019/09/i-commit-to-the-tech-pledge-and-ask-you-to-do-the-same/"><img src="./assets/Pledge_badge.svg" alt="https://www.techpledge.org/" width="125" /></a>
</div>

(I believe that) I am most widely known for making [Barinsta](./barinsta.html), an open source Instagram client on Android that focuses on privacy and well-being. Ultimately I was [cease & desisted by Facebook](https://github.com/austinhuang0131/austinhuang0131/issues/2), but at least I got some clout, so that's cool.

In my free time, I make code contributions to open source software that I personally use; see my [GitHub](https://github.com/austinhuang0131) profile. I occasionally draft [some inclusion requests](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/merge_requests?scope=all&state=all&author_username=austinhuang0131) for F-Droid. My newer personal projects are on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/austinhuang). Beyond code, I participate in the development and adoption of various [privacy frontends](https://github.com/mendel5/alternative-front-ends), some of which I host on [bus-hit.me](https://bus-hit.me).

I used to be heavily invested in Discord and have written [private Discord/Telegram bots](/services.html), but since then I became a proponent of ethical platforms, namely Matrix and ActivityPub. I run [JoinMatrix.org](https://joinmatrix.org) which hosts guides to onboard new users to Matrix. I help coordinate moderation and [promotion](https://servers.joinmatrix.org/) of public Matrix homeservers. I currently manage two Mastodon instances, [Mastodon Party](https://mstdn.party) and [MSTDN+](https://mstdn.plus).

My laptop is a MacBook Air (M2, 13-inch, 2022); My phone is a Sony Xperia XA2 (North American H3123). My VM stack is composed of the free stuff from Oracle (which I use to improve my Linux skills).

## My photos

I have a white Pentax K-50. I upload some ("Good" ones, due to Flickr's free restrictions) of my photos on my [Flickr](https://flic.kr/austin0131). I also post loyalty-free ones on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/@austinhuang). Though recently I haven't been taking photos...
